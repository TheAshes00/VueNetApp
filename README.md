# VueAppTest1
This is a .NET + Vue 3 project, developed not only to learn more about both .NET and Vue but to share my knowledge using both technologies. That said, I would like to show an easy integration of both amazing technologies, taking advantage of the easy-to-use architecture provided by Vue to create a flexible and adaptable frontend and the robust capabilities of .NET to build the backend of the project
